# The Vipps Test Environment (MT)

The Merchant Test Environment (MT) is available for all Vipps customers.

The environment is suitable for testing _most_ of the Vipps functionality, but some
functionality in the production environment is not available in MT.
In general, MT does not contain functionality that requires integration with
third parties, such as Payment Service Providers, EVRY, Nets, banks, etc.

Functionality not available in MT (a non-exhaustive list):
* Push alerts may be unstable
* Payment of invoices, both for Vipps Regninger and Vipps Faktura
* Limited support for testing card statuses that require connections to Nets, etc
* Limited support for looking up customer information in [KAR](https://www.bits.no/en/bank/konto-og-adresseringsregister-kar/), etc

To test functionality that is not available in MT, you will have to use the
production environment in a controlled manner. One example may be to test
Vipps Regninger with real invoices, but with small amounts. We recommend 2 NOK.

Other differences in MT:
* We allow 10,000 incorrect PIN attempts before locking the Vipps user's account

## Test users

The welcome email contains information about your test profile. The test mobile number is registered with everything required to complete a payment.

You can use this test user to in the [Vipps test apps](#vipps-test-apps).

**Important:** Do _not_ use the test phone number in production,
as the test number may be a real phone number for a real Vipps user.

If you need additional payment cards, you can add it in the Vipps app.
See [Credit card numbers](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/tree/master/testdata#credit-card-numbers)
for more details.

If you have not yet received the welcome email, see the
[standard reply](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/housekeeping/response-apinokler.txt)
(in Norwegian) for requests for this.

There is no way to get a test user in the production environment. 
The production environment only contains real users and data.

## Test amounts

Vipps supports using special amounts that are always rejected when approving the payment in the Vipps test app. The force approve endpoint is not validated for this functionality and will result in different behaviours. 

| Amount | Error                     |
|--------|---------------------------|
| 1.51   | Not sufficient funds      |
| 1.86   | Expired Card              |
| 1.87   | Invalid card              |
| 1.82   | Refused by issuer         |
| 1.83   | Suspected fraud           |
| 1.84   | Withdrawal limit exceeded |
| 1.97   | 3D Secure denied          |


## Vipps test apps

The test apps for iOS and Android are identical to the production apps, but connects to the
Vipps [the Vipps test environment (MT)](#the-vipps-test-environment-mt) instead of the production environment.

Only test accounts, with random phone numbers, are available in the test environments.
Normal Vipps users are not available, so you can not use your own phone number with the test apps.  

### Limitations of the test apps

* Push alerts do not work
